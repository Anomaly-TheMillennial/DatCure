# DatCure
DatCure is "that cure" to my data curation woes. Right now it is only an older text-to-image build, but I am working on a build for multi-modal datasets and robust text/chatbot dataset curation/generation. 


DISCLAIMER AND WARNING: This is a personal tool I made using LLMS (Claude, Gemini, GPT) to assist with my personal research in training text-to-image models. DO NOT use this for mission-critical aplications without proper backups unless you are okay with facotry resetting your project. That being said, I HAVE used it immensely and worked out many bugs.


One of the biggest issues with alancing datasets for AI is that you have to balance several different dimensions (like color, size, number, camera angle, lighting, style, race, class, outift, materials, or whatever you need for your use-case). The problem is that you can't sort your dataset in any way in file explorer that allows you too see everything and quickly work with a particular dimenstion. 

DatCure fixes this issue by allowing you to filter by tags so you can hone in on the particular dimenson of the dataset without having to hunt through a fragmented mess or having to bloat up all of your concept folders with duplicated that lead to secret overfitting.
